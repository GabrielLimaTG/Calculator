Calculator made with JScript


There's a bug:

1. The operation is made only by two numbers. If I add a "minus" sign with the +/- button, it 
gives an error because it can't read more than a sign or 2 separated numbers.


EDIT:

multi operations solved with a for loop. I still have problem with operations that start with negative number!
